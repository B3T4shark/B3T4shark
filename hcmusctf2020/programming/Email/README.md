### Challenge Description
ƒê·ªÅ b√†i cho m·ªôt file secret.txt v·ªõi g·ª£i √Ω: 

```bash
Dear Mr. AndyKun,

Thank you so much for inviting me to propose a challenge for the HCMUS-CTF 2020 contest and I wish that the HCMUS-CTF 2020 contest will be hosted smoothly.

In order to get the flag in my challenge, you will need to follow the below instructions:

First, you might have to decode the secret message:

0x536563726574206e756d626572733a20322c20342c2031302c2031332c2031382c2032302c20382c20312c20312c20382c20392c2031302c2033312c2031312e

The next steps are quite simple. You will find the flag in the attachment by deleting the lines in it. A line is qualified to be deleted if all of the following rules are satisfied: - Its length (including the END LINE character) is not divisible by 5. - It does not contains the string 'Q_bug'.

Now, you can get the flag by concatenating the 'nth' characters in the remaining lines, where n are the numbers in my secret message.

That is it, this challenge is so simple, right?

Good luck and wish you all the bests!

P/s: Note that the flag has its meaning and don't forget to put your flag in the correct format before submitting it.

Sincerely, Phidang.
